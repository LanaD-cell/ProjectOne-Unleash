Welcome to [Unleash](https://lanad-cell.github.io/ProjectOne-Unleash/)

For my first project, I chose to focus on a topic that resonates personally with me. As a dog owner, I often encounter challenges in finding dog-friendly locations and routes for walks. This website, currently named UNleash, is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform where users can easily find information on dog-friendly establishments such as restaurants, parks, hotels, and nature trails. The site also aims to foster a community where like-minded dog owners can connect and share experiences, making it easier to discover new places to visit with their pets.

Dog owners often face difficulties when trying to find suitable places where they can take their dogs. It can be time-consuming and frustrating to identify dog-friendly venues, particularly when traveling to new areas. Additionally, when visiting parks or nature trails, it's not always clear whether the location is worth the trip or what amenities are available. UNleash solves this problem by providing consolidated, easily accessible information on dog-friendly destinations and user-driven reviews to help pet owners make informed decisions.

Key Features that will expand in the future: 

Dog-Friendly Locations Database: A comprehensive list of dog-friendly parks, restaurants, hotels, and other venues, providing details on each location’s pet policies and amenities.
User Reviews and Recommendations: A review system allowing dog owners to share their experiences, helping other users determine the best places to visit.
Social Features: A platform for dog owners to connect and organize meetups, fostering a sense of community and facilitating social interactions among pet lovers.
Future Expansion Potential:
While the current version of the site is primarily informational, there are several opportunities for future enhancement:

E-Commerce Capabilities: The addition of a merchandise section selling dog-related products could create a revenue stream and further engage the community.
"Pocket Vet" Chat Feature: An interactive chat feature for users to discuss pet health or seek advice from others, though this is currently outside the scope due to technical limitations.
Insights Gained:
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in both problem-solving and implementation. While certain features, such as e-commerce and chat functionalities, have not yet been realized due to technical constraints, the website already addresses an immediate need by providing dog owners with relevant and easy-to-access information. The learning process involved in trying to incorporate additional features has been instrumental in expanding my technical capabilities.

Next Steps and Recommendations:
User-Generated Content: Introducing a feature where users can submit new locations or reviews would enhance the site’s interactivity and continuously update its database.
Interactive Map Integration: Adding a map feature would allow users to visualize dog-friendly locations and plan their visits more easily.
Mobile Optimization: Given the nature of the website, making it mobile-responsive will enhance usability, especially for users accessing the site while on walks.
Partnerships and Collaborations: Collaborating with local businesses, pet brands, or offering exclusive discounts could be a viable way to transition into e-commerce and build a network of engaged users.
In summary, this project not only addresses a personal need but also offers significant potential for expansion and growth. As I continue to build on this foundation, I look forward to incorporating more advanced features and expanding the site's functionality.

### Bugs and Fixes
 - When I deployed my project the first time, I realised I had some alignment issues, which I adjusted on Gitpod.
 - I also had some issues with the images I used in my README.md file, that was due to the path being incorrect.  
 - Found one error in W3C CSS Validator which I can not fix.
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/error css.png" style="background-color: black" alt="css error">
  </div>

 - One warning on the W3C Validator was not fixed, due to how I added my Hero Image in Index.html.
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/error index html.png" style="background-color: black" alt="css error">
  </div>  

 - The 2 errors on join the pack.html is contained in Bootstrap code used. I am unsure how to fix this without changing the Bootstrap code.
