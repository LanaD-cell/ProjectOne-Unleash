Welcome Reader,

For my first project I chose to stick to a topic that is relevant in my own life. I have followed the basic requirements for the project as there are many functions that I, as a user of the site UNleash, would love to have on the site. As a dog owner, I understand the challenge of finding new routes to walk. Dog owners also would love to take their companions out with them and that is why dogfriendly restaurants, hotels etc would be good to feature here. The social aspect is also very important. Creating a site for likeminded people to meet up. 
What problem does it solve? Normally it takes quite a bit of effort to find somewhere your dogs are allowed.Aditionally, when going to a new park, gardens or nature trail one does not always know if it is worth the drive and what facilities etc it offers. Many of my could haves would elevate the site considerably, but I just do not have the skill for a merchendise section or a chat section for "Pocket Vet". I did learn alot by doing and trying to figure problems out. 
The last update to this file was: **June 27, 2024**
